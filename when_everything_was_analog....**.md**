When everything was analog, there were only 97 possible tv stations.
Of course this was an expensive way of operating and the wider availability of personal cell phones created a need to tv stations to move to a smaller range of frequencies.
So digital television was born and we could subdivide frequencies within 32 stations.
TV stations were able to become landlords and rent out tiny studios in a 100 floor skyscrapper for way more than it was worth.
Now, in the 2020s an even newer form of digital tv is becoming standard which would allow a higher resolution of video within the same constraints.
