# When everything was analog...

When everything was analog, there were only 97 possible tv stations.

<figucaption>NTSC analog broadcast television, 1941-2009. Using the old rabbit ears one last time. Analog broadcast have mostly stopped, other than messages giving information on the conversion to digital. Broadcast screen from WWL TV 4 New Orleans shows graphics with website address and telephone number to contact for more information on the transition.

Of course this was an expensive way of operating and the wider availability of personal cell phones created a need to tv stations to move to a smaller range of frequencies.

So digital television was born and we could subdivide frequencies within 32 stations.

TV stations were able to become landlords and rent out tiny studios in a 100 floor skyscrapper for way more than it was worth.

Now, in the 2020s an even newer form of digital tv is becoming standard which would allow a higher resolution of video within the same constraints.
